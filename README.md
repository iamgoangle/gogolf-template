Here is a standard development pipeline installed.

You can reached pre-commit hooks and rules under `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration file.

## Commit Lint
The commit lint is make more sense of good engineering should be. Essepcially, the `commitlint`, in this template I've follow the convention here [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)


## Miscellaneous
### Set $GOPATH
The $GOPATH environment variable lists places for Go to look for Go Workspaces.

[https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH)

Add this to your profile. If you use *zsh* please also update `.zshrc`

```sh
export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
```

then `source .zshrc` for reload the the environment. You can check you GOPATH by `go env GOPATH`
